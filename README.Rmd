### Analysis Code

The **analysis/** directory contains code and data used in this paper. The intent is to provide a record of the steps - including data sources and the model structure. All of the code used in the analyses is provided, although it hasn't been run end-to-end as is so can not be considered truly reproducible. This is because many steps are slow, the WPDA data changed since it was originally downloaded, and both netCDF and Panoply can be finicky.

Analysis code was run in this order:

```
01-download_climate.R
01.1-combine_masks.R
02-append_terraclimate.sh
cd data/derived_data/
03-compute_biomass.sh
04-update_nc_metadata.sh
05-analysis.R
```

- `01-download_climate.R` downloads the TERRA-Climate data to the `raw_data` directory.
- `01.1-combine_masks.R` combines urban and protected area polygons and generates polygons stored in `/data/derived_data/not_suitable.gpkg`
- `0.2-append_terraclimate.sh` combines TERRA-CLIMATE data into a single file for each scenario in the derived_data folder. `derived_data` named `TerraClimate4C.nc` and `TerraClimate19812010.nc`
- `03-compute.biomass.sh` implements the model under different climate scenarios with rainfed, irrigation, and rock mulch scenarios (described below)
- `04-update_nc_metadata.sh` corrects metadata in output netcdf files
- `05-analysis.R` applies the urban and protected area masks, generates masked versions of the maps as netCDF files, and calculates the potential area and total biomass for each scenario.
- `06-figures.Rmd` generates the tables using Panoply and also provides alternatives to generating maps in R, but these were not used.

### Raw (Input) Data

- [/analysis/data/raw_data](/analysis/data/raw_data): 
  - TERRACLIMATE files must be downloaded to this folder using the `01-download_climate.R` script
  - WPDA Shapefiles can be downloaded from www.protectedplanet.net

### Derived (Output) Data

- [/analysis/data/derived_data](/analysis/data/derived_data): Outputs available
  - `coefs19812010.nc` calculated values of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\Gamma$ values for each grid cell under 1981-2010 climate normals for three water availability scenarios 
  - `coefs4C.nc` same as above but for $+4^\circ C$ warming
  - `allbiomass.nc` predicted annual biomass increments for _Agave americana_ under all climates and scenarios
  - `not_suitable.gpkg` polygons combining land classified as unsuitable for growing that is either protected (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2021) or urbanized (Kelso and Patterson 2010)
  - 
- [analysis/figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and Panoply (plotting software) configuration files. Contains all map figures generated using Panoply.
  - `*.pcl` files provide information about Panoply software settings used to generate the figures. In addition, these files can regenerate the figures with the command `java -jar PanoplyCL.jar [filename].pcl` using a `PanoplyCL.jar` that is available on request from the Panoply software author [Dr. Robert Schmunk](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/robert.b.schmunk).

## Analysis Steps


#### 1. Download TERRACLIMATE

```sh
# ~ 1h @10Mbps
cd analysis
Rscript --vanilla ./01-download_climate.R 
```

#### 2. Download WPDA Protected Areas

Per the [WPDA Data license](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/policies/wdpa-data-licence) this dataset can not be downloaded. 

1. Go to https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa
2. Download `WPDA_WDOECM_Apr2021_Public_all_shp.zip` 
3. Unzip to `raw_data/WDPA_WDOECM_Apr2021/`

#### 3. Generate mask of protected and urban areas

Combine WPDA with rnaturalearth Urban areas, generate polygons as 'masks.gpkg' 

```r
Rscript --vanilla ./01.1-combine_masks.R

```

NB at time of publication, this step does not run because of a bug in the rnaturalearth API. See https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth/issues/29 

#### 4. Append TERRACLIMATE and compute derived variables, 

The script 
```sh
./02-append_terraclimate.sh
```


##### Calculate PAR

2 * srad * 110 / 1000 * 18

$$
\textrm{PAR} = 2 \times \textrm{SRAD} \frac{W}{m^{-2}}\times  110\frac{\textrm{lux}}{W}\times 10^{-3}\frac{\textrm{klux}}{\textrm{lux}}\times 18\frac{\mu\textrm{mol}/\textrm{m}^{2}\textrm{s}^{2}}{\textrm{klux}}
$$
\times 1e-3 \frac{\textrm{klux}}{\textrm{lux}}} \times 18 \frac{\textrm{a}}{\textrm{b}}}

- SRAD: Mean daily shortwave radiation (W/m2) from TERRACLIMATE
- PAR: Photosynthetically active radiation in units of (umol photons / m2 / s)

- 110 is the average global annual luminous efficacy value of 110 lumens per W (Littlefair, 1985) in order to convert to lux (lumens per square meter)
- lux converted into the average daily PAR using the relationship 1 klux = 18 Âµmol photons m-2 s-1 of daylight. 
- Multiply by 10<sup>-3</sup> to convert from lux to klux.
- Multiply x2 to convert from mean PAR integrated over 24 hours to the flux over a 12 hours of daylight on average

##### Calculating Absolute Minimum Annual Temperature

$$
\textrm{absmin} = \textrm{tmin} - \textrm{cadj} -\textrm{adjustC}
$$

- `absmin`: absolute minimum annual temperature, the daily coldest minimum temperature
- `tmin`: average minimum temperature of the coldest month, climatological 
- `adjustC`: is from ERA5 and represents the difference in climatological coldest night of the year and daily average lowest temperature of a month. 
- `cadj`: perturbation from true coldest month to climatological coldest month

`cadj` is a minor adjustment to reflect the fact that ERA5 calculations did these calculations dynamically (coldest Tmin in a year minus Tmin of the coldest month) as opposed to using coldest Tmin of climatology. The former allows for the fact that in some years December might be the coldest, in others January. The climatology will tend to have a higher temperature of the coldest month than if these are calculated independently. 

#### 6. Model Implementation

The EPI model is implemented using NetCDF Operators in the file [analysis/03-compute.biomass.sh](analysis/03-compute.biomass.sh).
The key equations of the model are provided below for reference; a full description is provided in Niechayev et al (2019) and the manuscript associated with this archive Davis et al (_submitted_).

> Niechayev, N., Jones, A., Rosenthal, D., & Davis, S. (2019). A model of environmental limitations on production of Agave americana L. grown as a biofuel crop in semi-arid regions. Journal of Experimental Botany, 70, 6549-6559. 

**light index $\alpha$:**

$$
\alpha=
\left\{\begin{matrix}
0,                                   & \textrm{for } I< 0.6252 \\ 
-7\times10^{-7}I^2+0.0016\;I-0.0001, & \textrm{for } I> 0.6252 
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Where $I$ is the daily photosynthetically active radiation for the month.

**precipitation index $\beta$:**

$$
\beta=
\left\{\begin{matrix}
0,                                   & \textrm{for } P\leq 10.219 \\ 
0.0279\;P-0.2851,                                   & \textrm{for } 10.219< P< 46.061 \\ 
1, & \textrm{for } P\geq 46.061 
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Where $P$ is the average total monthly precipitation.

**temperature index $\Gamma$:**

$$
\Gamma=
\left\{\begin{matrix}
0,&\textrm{for}\; -3< T < 36\\
-2\times10^{-7}T^5+0.13\times10^{-4}T^3-3.878\times10^{-3}T^2+0.1052T+0.352 ,&\textrm{otherwise}
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Where T is the average daily temperature for the month.

monthly EPI:

$$\textrm{EPI}_\textrm{month}=\alpha\times\beta\times\Gamma$$

**Five year total EPI** is the sum of monthly EPIs multiplied by five:

$$\textrm{EPI}_\textrm{5 years}=5\times\sum_{0}^{12}\textrm{EPI}_\textrm{month}$$

**Predicted Biomass over a 5 year cropping cycle** uses the parameters from 

$$\textrm{Biomass}=1.7607\times\textrm{EPI}-14.774$$

**Simulating Rock Mulch**


$$\beta_{\textrm{rock mulch}}=\beta * 1.83$$


**Simulating Irrigation**

Calculate monthly water demand: 

Given $\beta = 0.0279\times\textrm{P}-0.2851$, find the values of $P$ where $\beta\geq 1$?


$$\textrm{P}_{\beta=1}=\frac{1+0.2851}{0.0279}\simeq= 46.06093$$


  - for each month if
    - $\alpha > 0$ AND
    - $\gamma > 0$ AND
    - $\textrm{P} < 46.061\textrm{mm}$
  - calculate irrigation required = water demand $46.01  - P$
  - annual irrigation demand = $\sum_{jan}^{dec}46.01 - \textrm{P}$ calculate sum over all months

**Simulating Freezing Mortality**

For any grid cell with absolute minimum annual temperature < -10, set biomass to 0.
