## Data Sources

**Climate data used as model inputs**

Abatzoglou, J.T., S.Z. Dobrowski, S.A. Parks, K.C. Hegewisch, 2018, Terraclimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015, Scientific Data,

**Urban and protected areas excluded from biomass predictions**

The following data was used to exclude present day 1) Urban Areas (Kelso and Patterson 2010; South 2017) and 2) Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2021)

## Model Description

$$\alpha=$$
$$\beta=$$
$$\gamma=$$
$$\textrm{EPI}=$$
$$\textrm{Biomass}=$$

### Simulating Rock Mulch

$$\beta_{\textrm{rock mulch}}=\beta * 1.83$$
### Simulating Irrigation

Calculate monthly water demand: how much precipitation is required for $\beta\gte 1$?

Given $\beta = 0.0279*\textrm{ppt}-0.2851$

$$1 = 0.0279*\textrm{ppt}-0.2851$$
$$\textrm{ppt_{\beta=1}}=\sfrac{1+0.2851}{0.0279}\simeq= 46.06093$$

- for any location where absmintemp > -10,
  - for each month if
    - alpha (light factor) > 0 AND
    - gamma (temperature factor) > 0 AND
    - ppt < 46.061mm
  - calculate irrigation required = water demand (46.01 mm) - ppt
  - annual irrigation demand = $\sum_{jan}^{dec}46.01 - \textrm{ppt}$ calculate sum over all months

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/az-digitalag/agave-prediction/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.
